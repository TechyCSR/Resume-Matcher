# Resume Matcher Documentation Folder

The `docs/` folder contains comprehensive technical documentation created through detailed codebase analysis to provide accurate project insights.

## Key Documentation Files

**`ACCURATE_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** - Complete technical overview with actual technology stack (uv, MarkItDown, Ollama), real API endpoints, database models, and implementation details discovered through code analysis.

**`project-context.md`** - High-level architecture covering the FastAPI/Next.js monorepo structure, AI agent system, and service layer patterns.

**`business-requirements.md`** - Product requirements documenting the ATS optimization problem, target users (job seekers), and core features with actual technology implementations.

**`parsing-algorithms.md`** - Deep dive into AI processing using gemma3:4b model, MarkItDown document parsing, vector embeddings with nomic-embed-text, and resume improvement algorithms.

**`data-models-schemas.md`** - Database architecture with SQLAlchemy async models, JSON schemas for structured data, and actual field definitions from the codebase.

**`api-specification.md`** - REST API reference with real endpoints from FastAPI routers, request/response formats, and middleware implementation details.

**`external-integrations.md`** - Third-party dependencies including Ollama v0.4.7, MarkItDown v0.1.1, OpenAI fallback, and actual dependency versions from pyproject.toml.

**`performance-requirements.md`** - System performance targets for resume processing, AI inference times, and scalability considerations.

**`security-privacy.md`** - Local-first processing approach, data protection measures, and privacy-preserving AI implementation.

**`architecture-design-patterns.md`** - Software patterns including service layer architecture, agent system design, and error handling strategies.

## Purpose

This documentation ensures new contributors can understand the complete system, maintains accurate technical references based on actual implementation, and preserves critical knowledge about architectural decisions and AI processing workflows.
