# Business Requirements - Resume Matcher

## Overview

Resume Matcher is revolutionizing how job seekers optimize their resumes for the modern hiring process. In today's competitive job market, over 75% of resumes are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before they ever reach human recruiters. Our mission is to level the playing field.

## Vision Statement

**"Stop getting auto-rejected by ATS bots."**

We're building the **VS Code for making resumes** - an AI-powered platform that reverse-engineers hiring algorithms to show job seekers exactly how to tailor their resumes for maximum impact.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Job Market Reality
- **98% of Fortune 500 companies** use ATS systems to filter resumes
- **Average of 250 applications** per corporate job posting
- **6-second average** human recruiter review time (if resume passes ATS)
- **75% rejection rate** by ATS before human review

### Pain Points for Job Seekers
1. **Black Box Problem**: No visibility into why resumes get rejected
2. **Keyword Guessing Game**: Uncertain which keywords matter most
3. **Format Confusion**: Unclear what ATS systems can actually read
4. **Generic Advice**: One-size-fits-all resume tips don't work
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Uploading resumes to unknown third-party services

## Our Solution

### Core Value Proposition
Resume Matcher provides **transparent, AI-powered resume optimization** that:
- Runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama (no data uploads to external servers)

- Suggests specific improvements with before/after comparisons using AI content enhancement (gemma3:4b model)
- Uses real ATS algorithms to test compatibility through structured data extraction with MarkItDown library

### Key Differentiators
- **100% Local Processing**: Your resume never leaves your computer - uses Ollama with local AI models
- **Real ATS Testing**: We reverse-engineer actual ATS behavior through structured data parsing and JSON extraction
- **Actionable Insights**: Not just scores, but specific improvement steps via AI-generated content enhancement
